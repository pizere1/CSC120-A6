Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- Like it's first most visible, I think that inheritance makes it easier and faster to programm than it would have been before.
-  I also think that the reliance on inheritance can get more confusing as one interacts with multiple classes and subclasses. For example, once can think that they have an access to a certain attribute that was used in the parent class when it was actually from a different class and that would make one to be have a hard time figuring out the right error especially if the codes are too many
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
- Most of the methods worked right yet some methods returned null while others had messy output when I accidentally made a method with almost similar implementation as those in the parent class in my first trials.
- I would advise someone taking this course in the future to always try starting early on their assignments and test their codes along the programming way because debugging gets harder as the code blocks get massive than they would have been if it was done before.
- I would also advise them to seek help when they need it and offer help if they can.
